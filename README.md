# 📊 Albion Blackmarket Reader

A free **market analytics & crafting profit suite** for *Albion Online*.
It pulls live market data, applies Albion's real in-game formulas (return rate, station fees, sales tax, focus cost) and tells you exactly **what is worth flipping, crafting, refining and cooking right now** — no spreadsheets required.

## Why use it

Albion's economy is deep, but the math behind a "good deal" is tedious: return rate, focus efficiency, station usage fees, city bonuses and the sales tax all move the real profit far from the naive `sell − buy`. This tool does that math for you, on live prices, so you can:

- spot **Black Market flips** that actually clear a profit after tax,
- know **which items to craft** for the Black Market and how much you make per craft,
- decide **where and how to refine** — including when self-refining lower tiers beats buying them,
- find the **most profitable meals and potions** to cook, with focus and buffs accounted for.

Everything is priced from real market data per region (Americas / Europe / Asia) and per city, and results that look "too good to be true" (bad/stale data) are flagged so they don't mislead you.

## 🧰 The tools

### 🏴 Black Market Reader (Dashboard)
The classic flip-finder. Compares Black Market prices against city prices and surfaces profitable trades, with charts, search, city selection, min-profit filters and a profit-history graph. Region switch (Americas / Europe / Asia).

### ⚒️ Black Market Crafter
Shows which items are worth **crafting to sell on the Black Market**: craft cost, Black Market sell price and daily sales volume, sorted by profit. Click any row to jump straight into the Crafting Calculator with that item, its tier/enchant, Black Market as the sell target and your craft city pre-filled.

### 🧮 Crafting Calculator
Full profit breakdown for any craftable item: material cost with **resource return rate**, **focus cost**, **station usage fee**, sales + setup tax, and net profit / ROI. Supports every tier and enchant, per-city material and sell prices, Black Market sell prices, and the correct **local production bonus city** per item type.

### ♻️ Refining Calculator
Refining profit for ore, wood, fiber, hide and stone across all tiers and enchants — with city prices, **return-rate presets** (base / city / focus / custom), focus specs, and taxes. Includes a **Stacking mode** that works out when it is cheaper to refine the lower-tier materials yourself instead of buying them, and shows a **step-by-step path** for each item so you can see exactly what to craft first.

### 🍲 Food & Potion Crafter
Profit for meals and potions, including **fish-sauce / arcane-extract enchants**, per-recipe **focus cost** driven by your Cook / Alchemist spec levels, station fees, sales tax and per-item profit. Handles Avalonian recipes (non-returnable Avalonian Energy) and Caerleon / Brecilien production bonuses correctly.

## ✨ Accuracy features (across all tools)

- **Real in-game formulas** — station usage fee `CEIL(itemValue × 0.1125 × stationFee / 100)`, return rate `1 − 1/(1 + bonus)`, sales + setup tax (6.5 % premium / 10.5 % non-premium), all matched to the community reference workbook.
- **Focus cost model** — `baseFocus × 0.5^(efficiency / 10000)` with per-spec efficiency, verified exactly against the workbook.
- **Return-rate presets** — royal city, local production bonus, focus, or a custom value.
- **Unrealistic-profit flagging** — deals built on bad or stale market data are greyed out with a warning so fake profits don't fool you.
- **Live regional data** — Americas, Europe, and Asia, per city, refreshed automatically.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite 6 + TypeScript (`Albion_ProfitChecker/ui`), tested with Vitest
- **Backend / data sync:** .NET (C#) fetcher that pulls the public Albion market APIs
- **Auth:** Supabase (gated dashboard + user profiles)
- **Hosting & CI:** Vercel (static build) + GitHub Actions (scheduled data refresh & merges)
